# Transformer-Generated Features Exploration

This repository is dedicated to exploring the usage of transformer-generated features and comparing their performance with raw features in various applications. The goal is to understand the advantages and limitations of using transformers for feature generation, as well as to provide insights and best practices for practitioners in the field.

## Overview

Transformers have shown great potential in learning complex patterns and relationships in data, making them suitable for feature generation in a wide range of applications. This repository will cover the following areas:

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Transformers excel at capturing linguistic patterns and dependencies, making them ideal for extracting features from text data.
2. Time series forecasting: Transformers can model long-range dependencies and temporal patterns in time series data, enhancing forecasting accuracy.
3. Recommender systems: By generating features for user-item interactions, transformers can capture complex user preferences and item relationships, leading to more accurate recommendations.
4. Computer vision: Transformers can extract features from image data, helping improve performance in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
5. Graph data and network analysis: Graph-based transformers can generate features for graph data, unveiling hidden patterns and relationships in networks.
6. Anomaly detection: Transformers can capture complex patterns in data, aiding in the identification of anomalies in various domains.
7. DNA sequence analysis: Transformers can model long-range dependencies and complex patterns in DNA sequences, making them suitable for DNA sequence analysis like classifying repeat sequences.
