# Transformer-Generated Features Exploration

This repository is dedicated to exploring the usage of transformer-generated features and comparing their performance with raw features in various applications. The goal is to understand the advantages and limitations of using transformers for feature generation, as well as to provide insights and best practices for practitioners in the field.

## Overview

Transformers have shown great potential in learning complex patterns and relationships in data, making them suitable for feature generation in a wide range of applications. This repository will cover the following areas:

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
2. Time series forecasting
3. Recommender systems
4. Computer vision
5. Graph data and network analysis
6. Anomaly detection

## Motivation

The motivation behind this repository is to:

- Investigate the effectiveness of transformer-generated features in various domains
- Compare the performance of models trained on transformer-generated features with those trained on raw features
- Analyze the trade-off between improved performance and computational cost when using transformers for feature generation
- Share findings, insights, and best practices with the community
